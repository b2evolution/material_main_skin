## Main Area Widget Aligns
In the newest version 1.1, you are in complete control of the widgets position. In the Main Area widgets can be placed on the left side (by placing the widgets in the <strong>Front Page Main Area</strong> container) or on the right side (by placing widgets in the<strong> Sidebar 2</strong> container).

## Secondary Area Widget Aligns
In the Secondary Area, widgets are displayed in full container width, but you can decide on the width of each widget by obeying the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/" title="Bootstrap Grid System Explanation">Bootstrap Grid System</a>.
